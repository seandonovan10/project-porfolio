Reviews:

1) Interstellar: 8/10

Coming into this movie, I expected it to be similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey as I had heard many comparisons between the two. Let me start this review by saying the two are MUCH different. Interstellar has many times more dialogue than 2001 but there are a few long shot moments in which there is no dialogue for an extended period of time, somewhat similar to 2001. Additionally, I thought Interstellar was much more straightforward than 2001 was. By the end of the film, I felt I almost completely understood the film whereas with 2001: A Space Odyssey there were much more questions than I had answers to. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing at all, it’s just that the two were much more different than I had imagined. Interstellar is more of an emotional experience where 2001 was more of a philosophical, thought-provoking film. The biggest similarity between the two is large moments of suspense and a large conflict/fight scene between two characters (I’ll try not to spoil this to much).

My favorite thing about Interstellar was by far the visuals and the score. Props to Hoyte van Hoytema and Hans Zimmer for essentially making the movie what it was, without them it would be an average at best film but they really made the sci-fi elements come to life and truly draw the viewer in. I’d give the visuals at least a 9 out of 10 as the scenes in space - particularly when they are flying to saturn and get stuck in a black hole were absolutely captivating. While there were a few dull scenes in the beginning that were more dialogue based, the scope of the cinematography really couldn’t be fully understood here. It wasn’t until about halfway through the film that it really started to blow my mind. I’d also like to give the score at least a 9/10, possibly a 9.5/10. It fit every scene so well, even the dull scenes seemed to be more captivating with Hans Zimmer’s beautiful score. My only complaint would be at times the loudness could be a bit overwhelming (shortly after Matt Damon is introduced, for example) but there’s no question it was beautiful and I’d say probably Hans Zimmer’s best score in years.

Now, onto the things that weren’t quite as good. The dialogue in this movie really made me cringe at times. For example, the line “the power of love” was used so repeatedly that I just couldn’t take it seriously at points. McConaughey kept saying that it would save everything and transcend time and space and I couldn’t help but feel I was watching a soap opera set in space that is focused much more on the fiction element of scifi than the science element. It was also very repetitive at points, specifically lines Matt Damon was telling Matthew McConaughey as he was walking away and the whole “power of love” nonsense. Despite these criticisms, there were almost moments of really good, heartfelt, emotional dialogue. For example, when McConaughey hears tapes from his children aging as he was on the ship truly felt genuine as well as when he’s talking to Matt Damon and McConaughey tells him there is a 50/50 chance of his helmet breaking and Damon replies, “That’s the best odds I’ve had in years” (see the film for yourself and you’ll see why this is such a great line in context).

Overall, I liked the film’s score and visuals very very much, but the cheesy dialogue, plot holes, overly repeatedly dialogue, and length really bothered me. I felt the plot was one of the Nolan brothers (the writer and director) was one of their worst but the atmosphere of the film was arguably their best. I’d say the movie is certainly worth watching, especially in theaters because of how beautiful the film’s visuals and score were so see it while it’s still and theaters and expect a great journey.

2) Gone Girl: 8.5/10

A few weeks ago I saw David Fincher’s new film Gone Girl. While it may not have been quite as visually spectacular as the film I just reviewed Interstellar, I thought this film was much more plot driven and had very exceptional acting. While I normally am not a big fan of Ben Affleck’s acting, I thought he did exceptionally well in this film. It seemed like he fit the casting for the film very well as his acting in the film seemed to be similar to his real life persona unlike previous films he’s worked in like The Town where he was portraying a character very different to who he is in real life. I was specifically surprised by the acting of Rosamund Pike as I had never seen her in a role in a film at all before. Additionally, the acting of Neil Patrick Harris was very well done as well but he was in much less of the film than I had expected.

Besides the score and the plot of the film, the dialogue is also very well done. It’s very interesting to see one of the central elements of the plot: how a man and a woman initially love each other then end up detesting each other and what they do in the public persona to make their relationship seem that it is working. I also found the soundtrack to be top notch. I think Trent Reznor is currently one of the best composers in the film industry currently and his newest work in Gone Girl won’t disappoint. I’d be highly surprised if he does not get another Academy Award nomination this year for his work. I would say it is very close to being on par with Interstellar’s soundtrack and it would be very interesting this year to see how that award will be given with at least two fantastic film scores in the running this year.

My favorite part of Gone Girl is probably how suspenseful the film is throughout. In the beginning, it takes a little bit of time to build up but within a half hour the viewer already has so many questions in his or her mind. How did the girl get kidnapped? Did Affleck’s character have anything to do with it? Are they both as innocent as they seem? In typical David Fincher fashion, all of these questions are later answered and with a good sense of resolution. The film truly succeeds in being a thriller that blurs gender roles and really gets the audience thinking. Although I gave this film a higher review than Interstellar, I would recommend seeing Interstellar in theaters before Gone Girl as the visuals are totally top notch and just wouldn’t be the same seeing on a television screen. Gone Girl would not be ruined at all on a television even though it has pretty good special effects as well, it’s just they aren’t quite as grandiose as the ones that are in Interstellar. My recommendation would be to see it in theaters if you’re a big David Fincher but else wise wait until it comes out on tv and save about ten bucks watching the film but I can mostly likely tell you, you won’t be disappointed. Fincher succeeds again.
